# README

Goal: Develop a web application to facilitate communication between a customer and a real estate agent.

The application is developed in Ruby on Rails. Additional details below.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

* Ruby version - 2.3.3

* System dependencies - Deployed on Heroku, local Development Platform was Windows

* Configuration

* Database creation - Postgres for Heroku	

* Database initialization - Already initialized

* UI: The UI is plain and easy to navigate, All the buttons serve the purpose. (Just make sure that when you click, the pointer has turned into a hand pointer. i.e it is on the Link)

* Adding images: Kindly add scaled images (low resolution), Other wise it will eat up the entire screen depending on the resolution. It will work, but it will be messy.
